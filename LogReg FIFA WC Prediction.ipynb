    "**Predicting FIFA 2018 Winner**\n",
    "\n",
    " **Method**:\n",
    "- Use data from Kaggle to model the outcome of certain pairings between teams, given their rank, points, and the weighted point difference with the opponent.\n",
    "- Use this model to predict the outcome of the group rounds and then the single-elimination phase\n",
    "- Compare results with the countries' talent scores\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis can be split into 3 portions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Firstly, we will use logistic regression to predict which countries make it to the single elimination round, and subsequently win the world cup.\n",
    ">(Reference to [Dr. James Bond's predictive model](https://www.kaggle.com/agostontorok/soccer-world-cup-2018-winner))\n",
    "* Secondly, we will use the talent scores of countries to better support the results of the finals matchup.\n",
    "* Thirdly, we will predict the actual scores of the finals matchup and 2nd runner up matchup.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predicted FIFA 2018 winner : Germany**\n",
    "\n",
    "***Takeaways:***\n",
    "\n",
    "Overlaying the output with the matchup predictions, we have 3 key observations:\n",
    "1.  The logistic regression model coupled with the talent visualization shows that of the 16 top overall talent countries,   11/16 of countries will make it through to the single elimination rounds. \n",
    "> While this is inconclusive, it does give an indication that the talent pool available is probably an important factor to a country's perfomance at FIFA. \n",
    "> The format of FIFA ensures that not all 16 of the top talent pool countries will make it through to the elimination stages with ease, there are multiple points of upset even before FIFA begins. For example, Italy was previously ousted due to losing to Sweden in the 2nd round playoff in Nov 2017, despite having one of the best talents.\n",
    "2. There are multiple matches with almost 50/50 chance for either side to win, this implies that the model is unable to predict with high confidence of some matchups and will need to be tweaked as the results unfold. **(this is what makes it interesting to watch isn't it)**,\n",
    "> In the quarterfinals matchup, Argentina vs Portugal, only 1 team will make it to the finals with the top 2 players by overall ratings (Ronaldo & Messi) leading on each side. Interestingly, the winning chances of Portugal is only by 0.01.\n",
    "3. In the Finals matchup between Belgium and Germany, there is a substantially higher overall talent score for Germany (82.58) as compared to Belgium(79.2), even if Belgium were to maximize it's potential, it will only hit a score of 81.7 (which is still below Germany's overall score). Hence, unless there is significant environmental influence, both the predictive model & talent assessment results indicate Germany as the champions of FIFA 2018.\n",
    "4. The finals is predicted to have a score of Germany vs Portugal 1-0 with the runner up being Portugal defeating Denmark with a score of 3-0. Overall champions is Germany."

    "Overlaying the output with the matchup predictions, we have 3 key observations:\n",
    "1.  The logistic regression model coupled with the talent visualization shows that of the 16 top overall talent countries,   11/16 of countries will make it through to the single elimination rounds. \n",
    "> While this is inconclusive, it does give an indication that the talent pool available is probably an important factor to a country's perfomance at FIFA. \n",
    "> The format of FIFA ensures that not all 16 of the top talent pool countries will make it through to the elimination stages with ease, there are multiple points of upset even before FIFA begins. For example, Italy was previously ousted due to losing to Sweden in the 2nd round playoff in Nov 2017, despite having one of the best talents.\n",
    "2. There are multiple matches with almost 50/50 chance for either side to win, this implies that the model is unable to predict with high confidence of some matchups and will need to be tweaked as the results unfold. **(this is what makes it interesting to watch isn't it)**,\n",
    "> In the quarterfinals matchup, Argentina vs Portugal, only 1 team will make it to the finals with the top 2 players by overall ratings (Ronaldo & Messi) leading on each side. Interestingly, the winning chances of Portugal is only by 0.01.\n",
    "3. In the Finals matchup between Belgium and Germany, there is a substantially higher overall talent score for Germany (82.58) as compared to Belgium(79.2), even if Belgium were to maximize it's potential, it will only hit a score of 81.7 (which is still below Germany's overall score). Hence, unless there is significant environmental influence, both the predictive model & talent assessment results indicate Germany as the champions of FIFA 2018."
